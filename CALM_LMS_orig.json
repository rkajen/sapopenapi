Business services can be used to represent a business functionality. This allows to abstract from the technical landscape details, which are typically unknown to the business users.\n\nThe business service process the cloud service status events (disruption, degradation, maintenance, communication), which are communicated by SAP in SAP for Me in the aspect of the corresponding business services. This allows you to see which business functionality is - or was - affected by a downtime event of a cloud service. \n \nIn addition, customer can define own status events on cloud services and technical systems. This is especially useful for your on-premise systems, which are not covered by SAP in the Cloud Availability Center, as they are operated by the customer. Here you can define e.g. planned maintenances or downtimes for your own systems and communicate this to your end users",
